        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> At my wedding people have raved about the view and venue,the ceremony and food .i don't think
          anything cringeworthy happened.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">we're going to a wedding this week that has a large gap, no DJ (they are having DH who is BM be in change of the music ),they just realized they need musics during food times .so i might need to update this list after the wedding.
       people still talk about my food,omg. if really gets brought up every time we see someone.
        nothing cringe worthy happened at my wedding, that i know of.(Ooo i did fall but that was just drink me missing the chair!) 
        at other.... went to a wedding on a golf course and they give the bridal party free golf the morning of. DH loved the one.
        cringe worthy was the dry, self catered wedding where the bride threw a fit beacuse everyone left after dinner. She hired a DJ. </p>

<h2>Why is mehendi important in weddings?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Mehndi, otherwise known as henna, is a paste associated with positive spirits and good luck . Mehendi represents the bond of matrimony and is therefore, considered a 'shagun'. It signifies the love and affection between the couple and their families</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">One of the most common (and important) prewedding events is the mehndi party. It's here that the couple is joined by their loved ones to get henna tattoos (or mehndi designs) applied to their bodies before the wedding day 
  The bride's side comes to celebrate, apply henna designs, and pamper the bride. The Jagoo (dance party) is more of the formal dance celebration but usually separate for the bride and groom. Nonetheless, there will still be dancing, singing, playing dohl (drum) at this home event.
  The mehndi mixture is made from a ground paste or powder from the leaves of the henna plant. While henna can refer to the plant itself, mehndi almost always refers to the finished product of henna used for the art.
  Yes, generally, applying mehndi (henna) is permissible in Islam for both men and women. While primarily encouraged for women as a form of adornment, particularly for special occasions like Eid and weddings, men can also use it, especially for dyeing hair. The Prophet Muhammad himself is reported to have used henna, and it's mentioned in Islamic texts as a way to change the color of grey hair.

  <p style="padding: 30px;">A Nikahnama is an Islamic marriage contract, also known as a marriage certificate in Pakistan. It is a legally binding document that records the details of a marriage, including the parties involved, the dower amount, and any conditions agreed upon. While not always mandatory in Islam for the validity of a marriage, it is encouraged as proof of marriage and is legally required in some regions. </p>
  <p>Yes, Khula is allowed in Islam. It is a form of divorce initiated by the wife, where she seeks to dissolve the marriage by returning the dower (mahr) or an agreed-upon sum to her husband. This right is rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and while the husband's consent is generally required, Islamic scholars acknowledge circumstances where a wife can seek Khula even without his explicit consent. </p>
